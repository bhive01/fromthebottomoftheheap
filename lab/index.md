Research in my lab relates to environmental change and how aquatic 
ecosystems respond to it over the long temporal perspective afforded by 
lake sediment records. I'm particularly interested in abrupt 
environmental change and using palaeo records to examine, test, and 
understand theories regarding critical transitions and their so-called 
early warning indicators. Another area of particular interest is in 
macroecological patterns and how these evolve over time and how they 
change in response to environmental perturbation.

Other research interests include

 * nitrogen pollution of remote oligotrophic lakes, and 
 * recovery of lakes from acidification and eutrophication.

My research involves a strong quantitative theme and I am keen to see 
how and where modern statistical methods can be applied to 
palaeoenvironmental time series to enable us to answer pressing 
ecological and environmental questions. Often this involves making 
allowances within the methods for the features of sediment records such 
as irregular sampling, dating error, and compaction of sediments.

My lab is based within the [Institute of Environmental Change & 
Society](http://www.iecs-uregina.ca) at the [University of 
Regina](http://www.uregin.ca).
