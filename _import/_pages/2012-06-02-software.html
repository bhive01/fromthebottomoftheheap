I have written or contribute to several <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> packages available on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>. Development of these packages tends to take place on <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org">R-forge</a>.
<h3>R packages I authored &amp; maintain</h3>
The R packages I have written allowed to scratch an itch or were needed for my research. The ideas behind the analogue package arose from my PhD and related work, whilst cocorresp was created so I could use the method of co-correspondence analysis without resorting to learning Matlab.

Package details:
<ul>
	<li>analogue</li>
	<li>cocorresp</li>
	<li>permute</li>
</ul>
<h3>R packages I contribute to</h3>
I have contributed code to two other packages on CRAN; <strong>vegan</strong> and the <strong>ctv</strong> package. I maintain the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Environmetrics.html">Environmetrics task view</a> in <strong>ctv</strong>. For information related to vegan, please see the <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/vegan/">project web site</a> on R-Forge. If you have suggestions for the Environmetrics task view contact me directly using the details listed in the task view on CRAN.

Package details:
<ul>
	<li>vegan: <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=68">Development version</a> | <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html">Current release</a></li>
	<li>ctv: <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=39">Development version</a> | Current release</li>
</ul>
