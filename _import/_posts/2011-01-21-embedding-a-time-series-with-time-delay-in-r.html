I've recently been looking at <a title="Martin Trauth's web page at The University of Potsdam Institute of Earth and Environmental Science" href="http://www.geo.uni-potsdam.de/member-details/show/108.html">Martin Trauth</a>'s book <a title="Matlab book page at Springer" href="http://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/computer+%26+mathematical+applications/book/978-3-642-12761-8">MATLABÂ® Recipes for Earth Sciences</a> to try to understand what some of my palaeoceanography colleagues are doing with their data analyses (lots of frequency domain time series techniques and a preponderance of filters).&nbsp;Whilst browsing, the <a title="Recurrence plots entry in Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_plot">recurrence plot</a> section caught my eye as something to look into further, both for palaeo-based work but also for work on ecological thresholds and tipping points.

In a recurrence plot, the recurrences of a phase space are plotted. As we tend not to have the phase space, just the time series of observations, we&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding">embed</a> the observed series to produce the <em>m</em> dimensional&nbsp;phase space.&nbsp;A key feature of the recurrence plot is the <em>time delay</em> included during embedding. There is an <code>embed()</code> function in R but it does not handle the time delay aspects that one needs for the recurrence plot, so I decided to write my own. The results are shown below in my function <code>Embed()</code>. It has been written to replicate the standard R <code>embed()</code> function where <code>d = 1</code> (i.e. no time delay), which is a useful check that it is doing the right thing.

[sourcecode language="r" gutter="false"]
Embed &lt;- function(x, m, d = 1, as.embed = TRUE) {
    n &lt;- length(x) - (m-1)*d
    if(n &lt;= 0)
        stop(&quot;Insufficient observations for the requested embedding&quot;)
    out &lt;- matrix(rep(x[seq_len(n)], m), ncol = m)
    out[,-1] &lt;- out[,-1, drop = FALSE] +
        rep(seq_len(m - 1) * d, each = nrow(out))
    if(as.embed)
        out &lt;- out[, rev(seq_len(ncol(out)))]
    out
}
[/sourcecode]

The arguments are:
<ul>
	<li><strong><code>x</code></strong>: the time series, observed at regular intervals.</li>
	<li><strong><code>m</code></strong>: the number of dimensions to embed <code>x</code> into.</li>
	<li><strong><code>d</code></strong>: the time delay.</li>
	<li><strong><code>as.embed</code></strong>: logical; should we return the embedded time series in the order that <code>embed()</code> would?</li>
</ul>
On a simple time series, this is what we get using <code>embed()</code> and <code>Embed()</code>:

[sourcecode language="r" gutter="false"]
&gt; embed(1:10, 4)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    4    3    2    1
[2,]    5    4    3    2
[3,]    6    5    4    3
[4,]    7    6    5    4
[5,]    8    7    6    5
[6,]    9    8    7    6
[7,]   10    9    8    7
&gt; Embed(1:10, 4)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    4    3    2    1
[2,]    5    4    3    2
[3,]    6    5    4    3
[4,]    7    6    5    4
[5,]    8    7    6    5
[6,]    9    8    7    6
[7,]   10    9    8    7
[/sourcecode]

And here we have the results of embedding the same simple time series into 4 dimensions with a time delay of 2:

[sourcecode language="r" gutter="false"]
&gt; Embed(1:10, 4, 2)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    7    5    3    1
[2,]    8    6    4    2
[3,]    9    7    5    3
[4,]   10    8    6    4
[/sourcecode]

So what does embedding do? Without additional time delay, <code>embed()</code> and <code>Embed()</code> produce a matrix with <code>m</code> columns containing the original time series and lagged versions of it, each column a lag 1 version of the previous column. Incomplete rows, that arise due to the lagging of the series with itself, are discarded. You can see this in the identical calls to <code>embed()</code> and <code>Embed()</code> shown above. There were 10 observations in the series, and we asked for 4 lag 1 versions of this series. Hence each of the series in the embedded version contains just seven observations; we loose three observations because the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns are progressively shifted by 1 time unit relative to the original series.

Time delay embedding allows for additional delay between the lagged versions of the original series. If <code>d = 2</code>, then each of the <code>m - 1</code> new series is lagged by 2 time intervals. This is shown in the final example above, with <code>Embed(1:10, m = 4, d = 2)</code>, where the entries within the rows are offset by 2. However, the embedded series now contain just four observations.

How we use this to produce a recurrence plot will be covered in a separate post.
