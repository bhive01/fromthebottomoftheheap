In a <a href="http://ucfagls.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/permute-a-package-for-generating-restricted-permutations/" title="permute: a package for generating restricted&nbsp;permutations">previous post</a> I introduced the <strong>permute</strong> package and the function <code>shuffle()</code>. In that post I got as far as replicating R's base function <code>sample()</code>. Here I'll briefly outline how <code>shuffle()</code> can be used to generate restricted permutations.

<!--more-->

<code>shuffle()</code> has two arguments: i) <code>n</code>, the number of observations in the data set to be permuted, and ii) <code>control</code>, a list that defines the permutation design describing how the samples are permuted.

[sourcecode language="r" light="true"]
R&gt; args(shuffle)
function (n, control = permControl())
NULL
[/sourcecode]

<code>control</code> is a list, and for complex permutation designs. As a result, several convenience functions are provided that make it easier to specify the design you want. The main convenience function is <code>permControl()</code> which if passed no arguments populates an appropriate <code>control</code> object with defaults that result in free permutation of observations.

[sourcecode language="r" light="true"]
&gt; str(permControl())
List of 10
 $ strata     : NULL
 $ nperm      : num 199
 $ complete   : logi FALSE
 $ within     :List of 5
  ..$ type    : chr &quot;free&quot;
  ..$ constant: logi FALSE
  ..$ mirror  : logi FALSE
  ..$ ncol    : NULL
  ..$ nrow    : NULL
 $ blocks     :List of 4
  ..$ type  : chr &quot;none&quot;
  ..$ mirror: logi FALSE
  ..$ ncol  : NULL
  ..$ nrow  : NULL
 $ maxperm    : num 9999
 $ minperm    : num 99
 $ all.perms  : NULL
 $ observed   : logi FALSE
 $ name.strata: chr &quot;NULL&quot;
 - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;permControl&quot;
[/sourcecode]

Several types of permutation can be produced by functions in <strong>permute</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Free permutation of objects, which we saw in the earlier post</li>
<li>Time series or line transect designs, where the temporal or spatial ordering is preserved</li>
<li>Spatial grid designs, where the spatial ordering is preserved in both coordinate directions</li>
<li>Permutation of blocks or groups of samples</li>
</ul>

The first three of these can be nested within the levels of a factor or to the levels of that factor, or to both. Such flexibility allows the analysis of split-plot designs using permutation tests. <code>permControl()</code> is used to set up the design from which <code>shuffle()</code> will draw a permutation. <code>permControl()</code> has two main arguments that specify how samples are permuted within blocks of samples or at the block level itself. These are within and blocks. Two convenience functions, <code>Within()</code> and <code>Blocks()</code> can be used to set the various options for permutation. For example, to permute the observations 1:10 assuming a time series design for the entire set of observations, the following control object would be used
[sourcecode language="r" light="true"]
&gt; set.seed(4)
&gt; x &lt;- 1:10
&gt; CTRL &lt;- permControl(within = Within(type = &quot;series&quot;))
&gt; perm &lt;- shuffle(10, control = CTRL)
&gt; perm
 [1]  7  8  9 10  1  2  3  4  5  6
&gt; x[perm]
 [1]  7  8  9 10  1  2  3  4  5  6
[/sourcecode]
It is assumed that the observations are in temporal or transect order. We only specified the type of permutation within blocks, the remaining options are set to their defaults via <code>Within()</code>.

A more complex design, with three blocks, and a 3 by 3 spatial grid arrangement within each block can be created as follows
[sourcecode language="r" light="true"]
&gt; set.seed(4)
&gt; block &lt;- gl(3, 9)
&gt; CTRL &lt;- permControl(strata = block,
+                     within = Within(type = &quot;grid&quot;, ncol = 3, nrow = 3))
&gt; perm &lt;- shuffle(length(block), control = CTRL)
&gt; perm
 [1]  6  4  5  9  7  8  3  1  2 14 15 13 17 18 16 11 12 10 22 23
[21] 24 25 26 27 19 20 21
[/sourcecode]
Visualising the permutation as the 3 matrices may help illustrate how the data have been shuffled
[sourcecode language="r" light="true"]
&gt; ## Original
&gt; lapply(split(1:27, block), matrix, ncol = 3)
$`1`
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    4    7
[2,]    2    5    8
[3,]    3    6    9

     [,1] [,2] [,3]

[2,]   11   14   17
[3,]   12   15   18

$`3`
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   19   22   25
[2,]   20   23   26
[3,]   21   24   27

&gt; ## Shuffled
&gt; lapply(split(perm, block), matrix, ncol = 3)
$`1`
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    6    9    3
[2,]    4    7    1
[3,]    5    8    2

$`2`
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   14   17   11
[2,]   15   18   12
[3,]   13   16   10

$`3`
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   22   25   19
[2,]   23   26   20
[3,]   24   27   21
[/sourcecode]
In the first grid, the lower-left corner of the grid was set to row 2 and column 2 of the original, to row 1 and column 2 in the second grid, and to row 3 column 2 in the third grid.

To have the same permutation within each level of block, use the constant argument of the <code>Within()</code> function, setting it to <code>TRUE</code>
[sourcecode language="r" light="true"]
&gt; set.seed(4)
&gt; CTRL &lt;- permControl(strata = block,
+                     within = Within(type = &quot;grid&quot;, ncol = 3, nrow = 3,
+                                     constant = TRUE))
&gt; perm2 &lt;- shuffle(length(block), control = CTRL)
&gt; lapply(split(perm2, block), matrix, ncol = 3)
$`1`
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    6    9    3
[2,]    4    7    1
[3,]    5    8    2

$`2`
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   15   18   12
[2,]   13   16   10
[3,]   14   17   11

$`3`
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   24   27   21
[2,]   22   25   19
[3,]   23   26   20
[/sourcecode]

As you can see, at the moment, I make some assumptions about the ordering of samples within each spatial/temporal structure. The samples do not have the be arranged in <code>strata</code> order, but within the levels of the grouping variable the observations must be in the right order. For spatial grids, this means in column-major order&mdash;just as in the way R fills matrices by columns. In a future release, I hope to relax some of these assumptions to make it easier to apply permutations to the data to hand.

In the next post in this series, I'll take a look at generating sets of permutations using the <code>shuffleSet()</code> function.
