Today I received confirmation that the delayed <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-94-007-2744-1/">fifth volume</a> in the <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1571-5299/">Developments in Palaeoenvironmental Research</a> series has been published. The book is titled <em>Data Handling and Numerical methods</em>, though it covers more of the latter and, IMHO, is far more interesting than the dry title would suggest (who gets excited by <em>Data Handling</em>? Well, one or two people perhaps ;-)

A <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-94-007-2744-1/#section=1058967&amp;page=12">full table of contents</a> can be found on the <a class="zem_slink" title="Springer Science+Business Media" href="http://www.springer.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">SpringerLink</a> website, though in their infinite wisdom, this material is not available as <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">HTML</a> but as embedded previews of the pages, which you can download as PDFs (as you can each chapter but for the proper fee).

I authored or co-authored three of the 21 chapters
<ul>
	<li>Chapter 9 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2745-8_9">Statistical Learning in Palaeolimnology</a> (with <a href="http://www.uib.no/persons/John.Birks">John Birks</a>)</li>
	<li>Chapter 15 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2745-8_15">Analogue Methods in Palaeolimnology</a></li>
	<li>Chapter 19 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2745-8_19">Human Impacts: Applications of Numerical Methods to Evaluate Surface-Water Acidification and Eutrophication</a> (with <a href="http://biology.uwaterloo.ca/people/roland-hall">Roland Hall</a>)</li>
</ul>

All three chapters relied heavily upon R; the first two being conducted entirely in R. Chapter 19 was written such a long time ago now that it wasn't all done in R (WA-PLS, Maximum Likelihood transfer functions methods weren't then available in R, nor were some of the ordination based methods I used). However, I'm confident the entire thing (at least the acidification parts) could be done using R now.

I have scripts for all the analyses performed using R. Some need a little work before I post them (mainly for Chapter 9) but I aim to maintain up-to-date scripts on my blog. Details soon.

Although writing these chapters took on a life of their own and used up far more time than they should have done, I am genuinely pleased with the results. I certainly learned a huge amount more about the statistics that underlay the techniques that palaeolimnologists and palaeoecologists use day in day out.

To pre-empt requests for PDFs of the chapters; I don't have any so don't ask. I'm not sure what arrangements were made originally with the publisher in that regard. I haven't even seen the final book yet either; still waiting on my copy to pop through the letter box. If you want a copy and didn't get in a pre-order at the discount rate, I suspect the best bet would be to pick on up later this summer at the <a href="http://paleolim.org/ips2012/">International Paleolimnology Symposium in Glasgow</a>, where I'm sure there will be a conference discount. If I hear of any offers in the meantime I'll post something here.
