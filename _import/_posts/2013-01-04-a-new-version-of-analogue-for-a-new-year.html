Yesterday I rolled up a new version (0.10-0) of <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/analogue/index.html">analogue</a>, my R package for analysing palaeoecological data. It is now available from CRAN.

There were lots of incremental changes to <code>Stratiplot()</code> to improve the quality of the stratigraphic diagrams produced and fix several annoying bugs. Also the definition of the standard error of MAT reconstructions was fixed; it is essentially a weighted variance but the original version assumed the weights summed to 1, which is not the case for dissimilarities of the <em>k</em>-NN.

Several new functions and additional functionality were added to the package:
<ul>
	<li><code>caterpillarPlot()</code> produces caterpillar plots showing species WA optima and tolerance ranges</li>
	<li><code>splitSample()</code> is a convenience function for sampling a subset of training set samples whilst ensuring that the entire environmental gradient of interest in the training set is evenly sampled.</li>
	<li>The <code>wa()</code> function received a lot of love in this iteration. The main addition is to allow non-linear deshrinking of the raw WA estimates alongside the more common inverse and classical deshrinking techniques. The deshrinking is achieved using a cubic regression spline fitted using the <code>gam()</code> function in package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html">mgcv</a>. The spline is constrained to be monotonic to make sure that the deshrunk values for increasing raw values are likewise increasing. Small tolerance handling in <code>wa()</code> with tolerance downweighting gained the option to replace small tolerances with the mean of all taxon tolerances.</li>
	<li><code>logitreg()</code>, which applies a logistic regression to the problem of identifying a critical threshold in compositional dissimilarity for MAT models, saw a major update. The returned object was substantially altered to allow for a wider amount of information to be supplied to the user. <code>fitted()</code> and <code>predict()</code> methods for class <code>"logitreg"</code> were also added. These compute the fitted probabilities for the training set samples and for new (e.g. fossil) samples respectively. The probabilities are in respect to the analogue-ness of samples to the groups in the training set (e.g. vegetation biomes in the case of pollen data).
These changes allow an analysis similar in spirit to that of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0033-5894(03)00088-7">Gavin et al (2003, Quaternary Research 60; 356â€“367)</a> in their Figure 8. Here though logistic regression fits are used and not the ROC method they use.</li>
</ul>
I'll be writing more on these ideas, especially the monotonic deshrinking and the logistic regression approach to dissimilarity threshold choice in future posts.
