As a member of research staff at the [IECS](http://http://www.iecs-uregina.ca/)
and before that at the [ECRC](https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/research/research-centres/environmental-change-research-centre), [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) my day-to-day duties have not involved
formal teaching commitments.

For many years I co-taught, and eventually convened, the ECRC's Numerical Course
with John Birks ([Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/John.Birks)).

Recently I developed an upper-level undergraduate & graduate course, *Modelling
Biological Data*, with Mark Vanderwel ([U Regina](http://vanderwelforestlab.weebly.com/))
where we emphasised likelihood and Bayesian approaches to modelling the kinds of
data commonly encountered in biology, ecology, and environmental science.

I have taught many workshops and short courses on the analysis of ecological and
palaeoecological data, often of an applied nature with a strong focus in the use
of the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical software. Recent examples
include

* [Fitting Non-Linear Models in R with the mgcv Package](https://noamross.github.io/mgcv-esa-2018/)

    This workshop was developed by David Miller, Noam Ross, Eric Pedersen, and
    myself and has been given at ESA meetings for a number of years.

* [International Paleolimnology Symposium R Workshop](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/ipa-2018-rstats)

    This workshop was given on the weekend before the joint <acronym title="International Paleolimnology Association">IPA</acronym>-<acronym title="Interantional Association of Limnogeology">IAL</acronym>
    meeting in Stockholm, June 15&ndash;17, 2018.

* [An introduction to Generalized Additive Models with R](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gams-yorku-canada-150)

    This workshop was given at York University, October 17, 2017

* [Advanced community data analysis using the vegan package in R](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/esa-advanced-vegan)

    This workshop was given for several years at ESA meetings, most recently in 2017.

* [Applied statistics and R for palaeoecologists & paleaolimnologists](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/adelaide-2017)

    This week-long short course was given at the University of Adelaide, February, 2017.
