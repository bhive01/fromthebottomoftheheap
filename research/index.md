My research interests are broad and involve a strong quantitative 
element, but the overriding aim is to better understand how fresh water 
ecosystems are influenced by and record environmental change. Current 
research interests and projects include

 * dynamical systems ecology & abrupt ecological change,
 * climate change effects on arctic lakes,
 * nitrogen pollution of remote oligotrophic lakes, and 
 * recovery of lakes from acidification and eutrophication.
