## What is vegan?
**vegan** is a community ecology package for R, implementing many popular methods including those for the analysis of ecological diversity and for multivariate analysis of community data.

### Features

 * **Diversity analysis**: Shannon, Simpson, Fisher indices, RÃ©nyi diversities and Hill numbers.
 * **Species abundance models**: Fisher and Preston models, species abundance distributions.
 * **Analysis of species richness**: species accumulation curves, extrapolated richness.
 * **Ordination**: support and meta functions for NMDS, redundancy analysis, constrained correspondence analysis, constrained analysis of proximities (all three 
   with partial analysis),
 * **Support functions for ordinatio**n: dissimilarity indices, extended dissimilarities, Procrustes analysis, ordination diagnostics, permutation tests.
 * **Ordination and environment**: vector fitting, centroid fitting and smooth surface fitting, adding species scores as weighted averages, adding convex
   hull, SD ellipses, arrows etc. to ordination.
 * **Dissimilarity analyses**: ANOVA using dissimilarities, ANOSIM, MRPP, BIOENV, Mantel and partial Mantel tests.
 * **Data standardization**: Hellinger, Wisconsin, Chi-square, Beals smoothing.
