## What is temporalEF?
**temporalEF** is a small R package for computing temporal eigenfunctions. Temporal eigenfunctions are based on principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) or asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) but for a 1-dimensional system, a time series. As with their spatial counterparts, these can be used to examine the time-dependent patterns of variance in a multivariate data set.

## Bugs, feature requests
**temporalEF** is still pre-alpha code. I'll get it up on github in the next few weeks and update this page.

### Features
