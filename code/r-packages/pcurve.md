## What is pcurve?
**pcurve** is a package for the R statistical software and environment. It implements principal curves, a non-linear form of principal components analysis, which is useful for analysing ecological data with a single, or dominant, gradient. **pcurve** was ported to R by Chris Walsh from Glenn De'Ath's S-Plus Library of the same name. I took over maintenance of the package in June 2013.
