excerpt: "[NERC](http://www.nerc.ac.uk 'NERC Website') recently funded the formation of the UK Lake Ecological Observatory Network (UKLEON) as part of the its [Networks of Sensors](http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/nos/ 'NERC Networks of Sensors home page') programme. UKLEON is led by [Ian Jones](http://www.ceh.ac.uk/staffwebpages/IanJones.html 'Ian Jones&#8217; staff page') at [CEH](http://www.ceh.ac.uk 'CEH Website') [Lancaster](http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sites/lancaster.html 'CEH Lancaster'). A fully-funded PhD project is associated with the UKLEON project, with the aim of investigating high resolution coherence in lake dynamics."

The successful student will be based at CEH Lancaster but registered for a
PhD in the [Department of Geography](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk "UCL Department of Geography") at [UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk "UCL website"), receiving co-supervision via both institutions. The project would suit a computer literate and numerate student, with a background in limnology/ecology/environmental science and some statistical experience an advantage, but full training will be provided during the PhD. The closing date for applications is 29 July 2011. See the UCL [advert](http://ucfagls.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ucl-lakesphdadvert.pdf) for full details of the PhD project and the application procedure. If you are interested in the PhD you can contact me or the other supervisors for informal discussions about the project.
