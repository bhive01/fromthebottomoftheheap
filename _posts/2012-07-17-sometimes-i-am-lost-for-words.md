excerpt: "Following on from yesterday's momentous announcements from UK Government and RCUK on opening up access to research outputs funded by the British tax payer, [John Wiley & Sons](http://www.wiley.com/ 'John Wiley & Sons') Inc. have [announced](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-104139.html) the [Geoscience Data Journal](http://bit.ly/NBJvG7) in partnership with the [Royal Meteorological Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Meteorological_Society 'Royal Meteorological Society'), the Met Office and [NERC](http://www.nerc.ac.uk 'Natural Environment Research Council')."

I first heard about this exciting new initiative via a submitted abstract from the EGU conference this summer. There need to be incentives for scientists to do more than just deposit data in repositories and data papers are a way to document their collection and processing and to acquire citations that indicate to the bean counters that scientists are making worthwhile contributions; having *impact* in the common parlance.

So I should be happy, right? Nope, not one bit!

Recall that RCUK and UK Government have mandated that no more restrictions than those covered by the [Creative Commons By Attribution](http://www.creativecommons.org/ "Creative Commons licenses")([CC BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ "CC BY")) licence may be imposed on tax-payer funded research published in the scientific literature. CC BY is also the industry standard amongst scientists being compatible with the [Budapest Open Access Initiative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Open_Access_Initiative "Budapest Open Access Initiative") (BOAI) definition of open access. Guess what licence Wiley have chosen for the Geoscience Data Journal? CC BY-NC, the non-commercial derivative of CC BY. And this is where words start to fail me... 

NERC is a major supporter of the Geoscience Data Journal. It is also part of RCUK and so bound by the recent announcements on open access. UK scientists in receipt of NERC funds will no longer be allowed to publish outputs from that research in the very journal NERC is supporting and was involved in setting up. This is staggeringly short-sighted of NERC, the editorial board and Wiley. It is not as if RCUK's decision has come out of the blue; a draft has been available for many months for consultation (I even [blogged]({{ site.url }}/2012/04/10/thoughts-on-the-propose-rcuk-policy-on-open-access-to-research-outputs/ "Thoughts on the proposed RCUK polcy on Open Access to research outputs") about it a while ago).

Quite why Wiley want to retain commercial rights to papers published in the journal is beyond me. They are obviously not satisfied with pocketing the Â£1000 ($1500) they will charge authors to publish papers in the journal. This should have been a PR win for Wiley and a win for the whole geosciences community. Instead it paints a picture of a publisher out of touch and out of step with the open access landscape within which it is operating.

I emailed Wiley's Science Press Room and Rob Allan, the journal's editor, making these points and requesting that the licence be reconsidered. If you want to do the same, email Sciencenewsroom@Wiley.com FOA of Ben Norman and Rob Allan (rob.allan AT metoffice.gov.uk). My email is appended below. I do hope that they listen...

    Dear Ben, Rob,

    I was alerted via Twitter to the press release from Wiley regarding the
    new Geoscience Data Journal. I was excited to learn of the new journal
    from an EGU abstract earlier in the year and have been looking forward
    to further announcements. What should be a positive addition to the open
    access landscape for the geoscience community now comes across as badly
    out-dated and suggests that Wiley and the people and organisations
    related to this announcement (NERC, Royal Meteorological Society etc)
    are way behind the times when it comes to open access.

    Why? The Geoscience Data Journal is licensed under a CC BY-NC licence.
    Firstly this is not a true open access licence according to the Budapest
    Open Access Initiative (BOAI) nor is it compatible with the new policy
    on open access announced by Research Councils UK (of which NERC is a
    part) yesterday. The BOAI has adopted CC BY as the level of restriction
    that should be placed on open access research "publications". This
    standard has been upheld by RCUK and the UK Government as the standard
    to which it will hold recipients of its research funds. It is the height
    of irony that, as it stands, no one in receipt of NERC funding would be
    able to publish those funded outputs in this new journal, which NERC has
    been instrumental in setting up. Similar restrictions related to
    publishing EU-funded work/data are being discussed ahead of the next
    major funding programme.

    Springer, one of your major rivals, has adopted CC BY as the licence for
    all it's open access journals. Elsevier has been publicly lambasted by
    the open access movement for it's adoption of non-BOAI-compliant "open"
    licences, which is but one reason that so many academics have pledged to
    boycott that publisher.

    By adopting the CC BY-NC licence for this journal you are severely
    restricting the potential pool of authors, undermining the commonly-held
    standard of CC BY for open access publishing, and going against the
    ground swell of recent announcements from the UK Government and other
    researcher funding agencies.

    I do hope that Wiley will take another look at the licence under which
    submissions to Geoscience Data Journal, and all it's open access
    offerings, are made available with a view to immediately adopting CC BY
    instead.

    I wish you well with this exciting new initiative, but unless the
    licence is reconsidered, I and many other scientists will be unable,
    morally or otherwise, to submit our data to the new journal.

    Yours,

    Dr. Gavin Simpson
