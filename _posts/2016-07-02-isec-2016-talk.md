My ISEC 2016 talk, *Estimating temporal change in mean and variance of community composition via location, scale additive models*, describes some of my recent research into methods to analyse palaeoenvironmental time series from sediment cores.

Using data from two varved lakes

* Lake 227, Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario, Canada, and
* Baldeggersee, Switzerland,

I use location scale generalised additive models to simultaneously model the mean (trend) and the variance of time series of fossil algal pigments and diatom counts.

These techniques may be applied to data from less ideal situations, where observations are irregularly sampled in time and have varying sample intervals/effects of time averaging.
