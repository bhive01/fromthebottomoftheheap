vegan active: blog --- Today I received confirmation that the delayed
[fifth volume](http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-94-007-2744-1/)
in the [Developments in Palaeoenvironmental
Research](http://www.springerlink.com/content/1571-5299/) series has
been published. The book is titled *Data Handling and Numerical
methods*, though it covers more of the latter and, IMHO, is far more
interesting than the dry title would suggest (who gets excited by *Data
Handling*? Well, one or two people perhaps ;-) A [full table of
contents](http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-94-007-2744-1/#section=1058967&page=12)
can be found on the
[SpringerLink](http://www.springer.com "Springer Science+Business Media")
website, though in their infinite wisdom, this material is
not available as [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") but as
embedded previews of the pages, which you can download as PDFs (as you
can each chapter but for the proper fee). I authored or co-authored
three of the 21 chapters

-   Chapter 9 [Statistical Learning in
    Palaeolimnology](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2745-8_9)
    (with [John Birks](http://www.uib.no/persons/John.Birks))
-   Chapter 15 [Analogue Methods in
    Palaeolimnology](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2745-8_15)
-   Chapter 19 [Human Impacts: Applications of Numerical Methods to
    Evaluate Surface-Water Acidification and
    Eutrophication](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2745-8_19)
    (with [Roland Hall](http://biology.uwaterloo.ca/people/roland-hall))

All three chapters relied heavily upon R; the first two being conducted
entirely in R. Chapter 19 was written such a long time ago now that it
wasn't all done in R (WA-PLS, Maximum Likelihood transfer functions
methods weren't then available in R, nor were some of the ordination
based methods I used). However, I'm confident the entire thing (at least
the acidification parts) could be done using R now. I have scripts for
all the analyses performed using R. Some need a little work before I
post them (mainly for Chapter 9) but I aim to maintain up-to-date
scripts on my blog. Details soon. Although writing these chapters took
on a life of their own and used up far more time than they should have
done, I am genuinely pleased with the results. I certainly learned a
huge amount more about the statistics that underlay the techniques that
palaeolimnologists and palaeoecologists use day in day out.
To pre-empt requests for PDFs of the chapters; I don't have any so don't
ask. I'm not sure what arrangements were made originally with the
publisher in that regard. I haven't even seen the final book yet either;
still waiting on my copy to pop through the letter box. If you want a
copy and didn't get in a pre-order at the discount rate, I suspect the
best bet would be to pick on up later this summer at the [International
Paleolimnology Symposium in Glasgow](http://paleolim.org/ips2012/),
where I'm sure there will be a conference discount. If I hear of any
offers in the meantime I'll post something here.
