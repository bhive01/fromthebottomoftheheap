A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending and 
participating in a symposium held to honour John Birks as he retires 
from the University of Bergen and becomes Professor Emeritus. The 
symposium, titled "At the Frontiers of Palaeoecology", took place on 
19--20th March in Bergen, Norway, and was a wonderful mix of colleagues 
old and new discussing John's contributions to the field of 
palaeoecology and their collaborations with him. Alongside this 
reminiscing were several presentations describing new areas of research 
by colleagues and collaborators of John.

I gave a talk on the first day, which was of the latter type. I made 
the case for the wider use among palaeoecologists of modern statistical 
methods that allow us to handle palaeoecological data as time series. 
For the most part, limited consideration has been given to the temporal 
aspects of stratigraphic data, principally because classical time 
series methods assume equally spaced observations and our dating 
methods come with considerable errors attached.

The slides from my presentation are available via
