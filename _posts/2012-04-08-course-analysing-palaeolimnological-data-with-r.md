The course will be held at the [University Marine Biological Station](http://www.gla.ac.uk/centres/marinestation/) [Millport](http://millport.org/) on the [Isle of Cumbrae](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&ix=seb&ion=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1680&bih=962&q=isle+of+cumbrae&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x4889bf59c61e9b6d:0x263706b6786736a1,Isle+of+Cumbrae&gl=uk&ei=71eBT8b-G8e_0QXx3_SGBw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=2&ved=0CC8Q8gEwAQ),

Analysing Palaeolimnological Data with R
----------------------------------------

{{ page.excerpt | markdownify  }}

The course costs **£300 + VAT** and includes food, accommodation and course materials. We have support from PAGES to assist with costs for young researchers from [developing countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country "Developing country") (see below). Please note that you **do not** need to register for IPS2012 to attend the R course; it is open to anyone. The course will
cover many topics of particular interest to palaeolimnologists and palaeoecologists. Details can be found on the [course website](http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/staff/stephen.juggins/courses/PalaeoDataWithR.htm) and a [detailed programme](http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/staff/stephen.juggins/courses/PalaeoData_With_R_Course.pdf) [PDF] is available. ~~Registration for the course is now open via Newcastle University.~~Registration for the course is now closed.

Support for young researchers from developing countries
-------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to the generous support of [PAGES](http://www.pages-igbp.org/) we are able to cover travel, subsistence and course costs (up to £1100) for five young researchers from developing countries. If you would like to apply for PAGES financial support please send a CV and short covering letter outlining your research interests and why the course will benefit you to both Gavin and Steve (our contact details are on the course website). The **deadline** for applying for PAGES support is **15th May 2012**. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. We look forward to seeing you in August.
