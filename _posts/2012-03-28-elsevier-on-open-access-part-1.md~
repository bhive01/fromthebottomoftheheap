active: blog --- In the past few days I've come across two advertorials
(articles or editorials if I'm being generous) from Elsevier in the
context of newsletters sent to editors and authors. Here I consider the
[one sent to
editors](http://editorsupdate.elsevier.com/2012/03/copyright-in-an-open-access-world/) that
Ross Mounce ([@rossmounce](https://twitter.com/#!/rmounce)) tweeted
about earlier today. The opening paragraph sets the scene and paints
Elsevier and similar publishers in a good light as the Guardians of
copyright. Ironically, by requesting copyright transfer from authors to
Elsevier, they aren't really protecting the copyright of the author any
longer (just their [moral
rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights_%28copyright_law%29 "Moral rights (copyright law)"));
the author has signed away their copyright so Elsevier is protecting its
own interests and those of its shareholders. The next paragraph really
annoys me! I quote

> To all intents and purposes, the fact that journal articles are being
> made available to all through open access, or to subscribers under the
> subscription model, should not really affect things.  Issues can
> arise, however, as there is a common misperception that open access

Firstly respecting copyright applies just as equally to Open Access
articles as it does to those behind publishers' paywalls. Second, we
have a very clear description of Open Access in the form of the
[Budapest Open Access
Initiative](http://www.soros.org/openaccess) definition of [Open
Access](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm#openaccess). Some
publishers (like
[Springer](http://www.springer.com/open+access/open+choice?SGWID=0-40359-0-0-0))
get this and their Open Access offerings are under a [Creative
Commons](http://creativecommons.org/)
[CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) licence which as
long as the original work is attributed you can do what you want with
the content. Yet Elsevier have a sorry excuse for an ["open access"
licence](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authors.authors/sponsoredarticles_user)
which is somewhat like CC-NC-SA but with extra restrictions; its not
"open" if what you can and can't do with it is controlled to such a
degree. Issues can certainly arise if you muddy the waters and don't
follow an accepted standard!

I'm not sure what this has to do with "open access"? I can't imagine
Elsevier pays a legion of minions to scour the web and print literature
looking for copyright infringement. If they are alerted to any
infringement they can bring their lawyers to bare, but an author could
do the same (perhaps without the same depth of pocket) or alert journal
editors to the plagiarism or fraud. Elsevier then suggests that

> If copyright is retained, then this process [upholding of author
> rights] remains with the author and, if it is shared, there is a
> greater risk that fraudulent use may occur, which is why we continue
> to advocate the transfer of copyright for our journals.([Tempest,
> 2011](http://editorsupdate.elsevier.com/2012/03/copyright-in-an-open-access-world/))

It really is unclear what they mean by "sharing" copyright but
regardless, why should the risk of fraud be greater because the author
not Elsevier is the copyright holder? Tempest claims that Open Access
journals, in allowing extra usage rights, introduce confusion over
copyright. How exactly is it more confusing if this is an Open Access
journal? The only way confusion is increased is if the rights of the
user are not clearly indicated at the point of access. Most journals
that allow Open Access articles are quite clear about rights granted to
the user and use a clear, well-recognised licence like CC-BY. The one
publisher I know that [obfuscates user
rights](http://svpow.com/2012/03/19/understand-elseviers-open-access-licence-part-4-who-owns-copyright/)
for "open access" articles, one that spreads confusion not reduces it,
is Elsevier. The advertorial closes with a general comment that the main
issues with copyright are a general lack of understanding as to what it
is and apathy about it importance. Again, Tempest, I ask you what does
this have to do with Open Access? It is clear that this propaganda piece
is designed to play on the poor level of understanding of and apathy
towards copyright issues in its pool of journal editors. None of the
concerns raised applies solely to Open Access journals or articles;
unless you give away your copyright by placing works in the public
domain (and even then it may not be possible in some jurisdictions to
give up all your rights) copyright applies whether it is the author or
Elsevier that holds the copyright^1^. By linking Open Access with a
murky world of potential or perceived threats arising from the chaos of
authors' retaining their copyrights Elsevier are travelling a well worn
path when it comes to vested interests reacting to a threat to their
business model; we've seen similar strategies in open access software
and climate change to name but two. If Elsevier are as committed to
improving access to articles and working for the benefit of authors as
they claim they are, they should stop spreading this
[FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) that can
only lead to confusion and uncertainty in the very people they claim to
want to help. Ultimately Elsevier will be judged by their actions; to
date they have hardly ingratiated themselves with academics. I do wonder
when they will realise that in the long run their actions will only harm
their business? ^1^ In the US unless you register you copyright on a
work (for a fee) then potential damages for copyright infringement are
reduced. Publishers will register your works on your behalf (well
theirs!). But given that the key reason of choosing Open Access is to
remove restrictions on use other than attribution, I'm not sure how huge
damages/fees apply.
